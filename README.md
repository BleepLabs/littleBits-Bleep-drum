littleBits started the bitlabs in 2014 to get other people to develop new things for their ecosystem. 
Unfortunately they canceled the project before producing any devices and deleted all record of it, including their github. 

I recently found the last version of the software and hardware I sent them and after someone on youtube informed me that they were selling their proprietary connectors again I decided to put it all up here.
